            <p> Your education and any choice related to it is a very crucial decision in your life, and therefore before taking a leap you should be aware of how to use your years of inculcated knowledge, otherwise saying what do you want to do post your
                academic course is over. Your focus plays a very important role in making your future, as it is what is going to help you decide how soon and with what you are going to start your career. Agreed, that many of you will not be able to makeup
                your mind about what you want to do post your 10th. However, for those who have found a keen interest in a particular area, or have been mastered a subject, then choosing to do a diploma in that field will be a good decision. On the contrary,
                if you are not sure as to which course appeals to you the most, then taking your own time and enrolling into a degree course will be best. That been said, before taking any major stand, having a thorough understanding of what exactly is
                the difference between a degree, a diploma and a certificate course will help you to set a course for your future. Difference Between Diploma, Degree & Certificate Courses: The major difference between a diploma, degree and a certificate
                course is of duration. A certification course is usually six months to a year, though there are some certificate courses that last for 1.5 to 2 years too. A diploma course can be of a yearly or a semester pattern. Most of the time a Diploma
                in Engineering yearly pattern have a duration of three years. The diploma that follows semester pattern, is usually of four years, with three years dedicated to studies and one year devoted to an industrial internship. Generally the duration
                of a degree course in India is usually 3 years barring a few like B.Sc (Agriculture) which is a 4 years course, Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) a 5 year duration course, Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine & Surgery (B.A.M.S) a 5.5 year course,
                and not to forget that B.Tech is a 4 year course.

                        For too long, education in India has been demarcated into two distinct streams - academic and vocational. The vocational programmes were never integrated with higher education and an almost puritanical attitude towards higher education was on display.
                        Thankfully, this attitude is changing. Nowadays, students are searching more for job oriented Diploma courses to pursue along with their degree courses. Many students now look forward to pursuing a course that would get them a
                        job and are not too worried if it is a degree or not.
